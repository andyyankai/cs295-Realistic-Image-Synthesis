Ray Tracing for shadows [Appel 1968]
Recursive Ray Tracing [Whitted 1980]
Distributed Ray Tracing [Cook et al. 1984]
Radiosity [Goral et al. 1984] break through, new techic, computer generate image, cornell box. Largly diifuse. only simple scene
Hierarchical Radiosity [Hanrahan et al. 1991] Complex, lighting, shallow
Non-Diffuse Radiosity [Sillion et al. 1991] 
Monte Carlo Path Tracing [Kajiya et al. 1986] Siggraph, rending equation mathimamticly define physics based. COmputerational intense. Generate many sample to get clean image. Complexity and sturture not matter. Very expensive in 80s but good recently.
Bidirectional Path Tracing
MLT: markov chain based, any sample only based on the pervious one.

Radiometry & BRDFs
Radiometry
  complicated
  Light travels in straight lines
  Unpolarized
  Ray properties:
    Wavelength: color(RGB)  
    Intensity
  Geo and rad
  In geo, light as particles
  polarization not assumed
  
  turning machine, energy loss transport kernel.
  
  absorbtion of light

Hemispheres is 2d surface, 2 parmater theta:elevation angle, phi: curve
solid angles: small area on surface, r is radiance theta is the angle d phi is

spherical oordinate:
2pi

density of power

vacumme radiance on the lane remain same
solid angle decrease when light source further for area light

point source, 4pirsuare2

BRDFs:
income light and outcome light, two direction
no nagivative light
energy conservation

rough, diffuse
smooth, specular
ideal diffuse no energy loss
ideal specular, normal is between w and w'

microfacet BRDF

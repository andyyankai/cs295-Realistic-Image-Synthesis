Topic: Direct illumination and Monte Carlo integration

indirect: more complex, reflect twice

Uniform sqpherical light: w_i is interval of adphsisiphere
dw is the small area
omiga is the hemisphere

w = [[sin theta cos phi][sin theta sin phi][cos theta]]

Monte Carlo: high dimensional problem
focus on expect value

Strong law of large number: large number of independed samples, and then calculate the sample mean.
Hence sample mean = actual mean

density function: anything but f(x)>0 p(x)>0

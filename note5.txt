Inverse method: find rua then get the sample.
normal distribution have no close form of function F.
not scale well in high Dimention.

rejection sampling: f 
MH algorithm is a chain rule

first draw distance d,
circle
 problem
samples are correlated
initial sample may follow a different distribution

alias sample, spread out mapping

inverting f:
apha x = c

theta = cos-1(1-sph)
cos theta - 1-2theta
